# Heart-Disease-Predictor
A Gradio-based GUI that determines if a patient has a Heart Disease using the Logistic Regression model. 

## Libraries Used
[Gradio](https://gradio.app/docs/)

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

[Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

## Working 
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data). 

The data was analysed with the Pandas library to display the data in a tabular form. Seaborn was used for graphical analysis. Then, the data was split into training data and test data in the pre-processing stage. 

The data was then processed using Logistic Regression Algorithm and accuracy was calculated. Then, the trained model was stored in a Joblib file. 

Using Gradio, a GUI library, the Interface was created. The patients details are entered and depending on the result (0= negative, 1= positive) the reuslt is computed. Two demo examples have also been given to depict either case of a patient.
